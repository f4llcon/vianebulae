## About

Via Nebulae is a speculative fiction catalogue and review website developed as a final project for CS50. It allows users to explore a curated collection of speculative fiction books, movies and games, and share their reviews with the community.

Credits to Open Movie DB and Open Library APIs, and to ChatGPT for doing some grunt work (like building this readme).
